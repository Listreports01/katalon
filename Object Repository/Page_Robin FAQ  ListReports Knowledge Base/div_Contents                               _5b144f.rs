Agents



What is Robin®?



Robin® is a collaborative home search tool and a report that simplifies local real estate.



Who has access to Robin®?



Robin® is a consumer app that is currently available for select markets at this time.The ListReports® team is working hard to get the final platform ready to welcome a larger group of agents and loan officers soon! 



How much does Robin® cost?



Robin® is a premium service, meaning it is included with a ListReports® Acquire membership for loan officers. Agents can unlock immediate, free access to Robin® by co-branding with an Acquire loan officer. 



What is a Robin® home report?



Take control of your home journey with the report that simplifies local real estate. 



Robin® home reports are a new free feature that allows your clients to add their home address and instantly receive a snapshot of their home’s value. Once their address is added, they’ll also see local real estate trends, neighborhood market data, and featured properties in their area. With your branding front and center, you’re positioned as the expert and your clients will feel empowered to reach out with questions, search for investment properties, or start their next home search.



To access this feature as an agent, navigate to your My Leads tab, then click on the “View” button to access the buyer’s board in guide-mode.



Are our team members licensed real estate agents?



Though we have licensed real estate agents on our team, because our team structures their communication around the accuracy of Robin®-related products (including emails and property searches), any real estate-related questions are directed to you, the licensed real estate professional. This offers you the best opportunity to connect with your leads on a personal level and establish yourself as the expert!



Does Robin® generate leads?



No, Robin® is a lead nurturing service that cultivates existing agent leads and does not generate new leads. 



How do I access my client’s Robin® board?



A client’s Robin® board can be accessed from the My Leads page of your ListReports® account. Simply navigate to the My Leads tab and click “View” to visit a particular client’s Robin® board. 



What does my client get from Robin®?



Robin® provides a suite of free organizational tools to your client to help them better manage their home search. This includes a collaborative board where they can organize homes, a home comparison tool, a design idea board, shared notes, and more! 



How do I invite a new client to Robin®?



All you need is a client’s name and email in order to send their exclusive Robin® invite by email. 



From your My Leads tab, hit the “Invite” button next to the client’s contact information. If you have not yet added the client to your My Leads tab, you can simultaneously add them as a lead and invite them to Robin® via the large red button at the top of the page. Hit the Invite to Robin button at the top of the page and you’ll be prompted to add them as a lead and send their invite at the same time. 



How do I send listings to my Robin® clients to review?



Start by viewing their Robin® board – click the “View” button next to a client’s contact information in the My Leads section of your ListReports® account. Once you’re on their Robin® board, you’ll see a “Recommend Properties” button in the bottom right-hand corner. Click this button to send a new listing – or group of listings – to your client to review. 



These new recommended listings will appear at the top of their Robin® board, along with a note that lets them know you hand-selected these properties for them. 



Do my clients need to pay for Robin®? 



No! Robin® is free for consumers, meaning homebuyers don’t pay to use the platform or download the app.



Can home buyers use Robin® without an agent? 



No! Robin® is an invite-only platform – meaning buyers cannot access the platform unless they’ve received an invite from an agent. 



How will I know if my client is using Robin®? 



You will receive automated notifications when your client takes action within Robin® – making it easy to know when to reach out. 



You’ll receive a notification when your clients:



Accept their invitation and register for Robin®Invite a co-buyer to their Robin® accountSave a new search Remove a searchUpdate their search preferencesAdd a new home to the board from outside of Robin® Add a new home to their “Maybes” column Move a home into their “Favorites” or “Make an Offer” columns Add a new note on a house and opt to share it with youPin a photo to their idea boardSchedule an open house viewing through Robin®Request a private viewing appointmentWould like to submit a formal offer on a propertyHave a home on their board that goes off the marketWhen a co-buyer accepts their invitation and registersWhen a co-buyer is removed or leaves the board 



At what point is a nurtured lead handed over to the agent?



Because the goal of Robin® is to start a conversation with the agent, any and all buyer questions are directed to you, the agent, for a response. Whenever a lead engages by reaching out with questions, creates a note to the agent, or schedules a showing in Robin®, we immediately alert you by email and text so that you never miss out on an opportunity and can take it from there!



Does ListReports® provide our leads to 3rd party vendors? If so, will these 3rd party vendors be marketing to the leads we provide?



No, ListReports® does not sell the consumer information you provide us to any 3rd party. We share your consumer information (i) at your direction or (ii) with certain 3rd party partners with whom we’ve contracted to help operate our products and services, and then only as needed to perform specific tasks on our behalf.

Loan Officers



What is Robin®?



Robin® is a collaborative home search tool and a report that local real estate. 



Who has access to Robin®?



Robin® is only available for select MLSs at this time. The ListReports® team is working hard to get the final platform ready to welcome a larger group of agents and loan officers soon! 



How do agents access Robin®?



Only licensed real estate agents with a ListReports® account that is paired with a loan officer who has a ListReports® Acquire membership unlock immediate access to Robin®. Robin® is accessed via the My Leads tab in their ListReports® account. 



Can loan officers invite a client to Robin®? 



At this time, only agents can invite clients to Robin®. 



How do I know if a client is using Robin®? 



Start by navigating to the My Leads tab of your ListReports® account. Click the tab that says Robin Buyers to view any clients that have been invited to Robin® by agents paired with you. If a client has accepted the invitation and started using Robin®, you’ll see a large View button next to their information. 



Can loan officers view a client’s Robin® board? 



Yes! Loan officers will have a limited view of client Robin® boards associated with the agents that the LO is paired with. This does not, however, enable the LO to access, generate, or add MLS data to any Robin® board. 



To access a client’s Robin® board, simply navigate to the My Leads tab in your ListReports® account, click into the Robin® Buyers section, and select the View button for any particular client. If you don’t yet see a View button next to their name, it means the client has not yet accepted their Robin® invitation and still needs to set up their free account. 



Do you provide loan officers with any data, metrics, or insights into how agents and homebuyers are using Robin®?



Yes! Loan officers are notified when a paired agent invites a new client to Robin®. They are also notified when home buyer leads perform key actions within the Robin® platform such as registering, scheduling an open house or private viewing, moving a home on the board, or clicking the Submit an offer button. 



Are loan officers featured in a client’s Robin® account?



Yes! All clients will have easy access to their agent’s paired loan officer in the Mortgage Center. The Mortgage Center is featured prominently within the client’s Robin® account, and it allows them to quickly reach out in one click. They’ll see your photograph, name, company, phone number, and email every time they visit the Mortgage Center. The Mortgage Center also includes additional resources to help them understand the mortgage process. 



As a loan officer, when will I see Robin® activity?



Because Robin® helps convert agent leads into active clients, you may not see any activity until the agents you are paired with start using Robin®. We recommend letting agents you work with know about the benefits – once they sign up, you will be able to see their activity. If you have further questions or would like us to reach out to agents to introduce them to Robin® on your behalf, simply let us know and we’d be happy to do so!



Do I need to pay for Robin®?



Yes! In order to use Robin®, you will need to pay a software service fee for an Acquire ListReports® account.



Does ListReports® provide our leads to 3rd party vendors? If so, will these 3rd party vendors be marketing to the leads we provide?



No, ListReports® does not sell the consumer information you provide us to any 3rd party. We share your consumer information (i) at your direction or (ii) with certain 3rd party partners with whom we’ve contracted to help operate our products and services, and then only as needed to perform specific tasks on our behalf.

Consumers



What is Robin®? 



Robin® is a collaborative home search tool and a report that simplifies local real estate. 



Who has access to Robin®? 



Only home buyers who have received an invitation from their agent can access Robin® at this time. 



Do I need to pay for Robin®? 



No! Robin® is completely free for home buyers and co-buyers to use. 



Do I need a Robin® account?



Yes! In order to access Robin®, home buyers will need to create an account with their email address. 



How do you make money? 



Agents and loan officers pay to use Robin® and the other real estate marketing services that ListReports® provides. 



How do I invite a co-buyer to my board? 



Buyers can invite a co-buyer by clicking on their account icon in the upper righthand corner of the board and selecting Co-buyers. They then hit the Invite button and enter in the co-buyers contact information, before hitting the final Invite button. 



Who else will be working with me on my board? 



Robin® is a collaborative home buying experience. In addition to any co-buyer you may invite, the agent you are paired with will be there to help you discover and curate properties and will track your progress.



In addition, the loan officer who is connected with your paired agent on Robin® will also be available to provide financing information when needed, and will be able to track your progress. The decision about which loan officer you choose to work with is up to you, and it does not affect your access to Robin®. 



Designed for providing feedback on your home search, Notes are shared between Buyers and Co-Buyers by default. Additionally, the Buyer and Co-Buyer can choose to share a Note with their Agent or both their Agent and that Agent’s paired Loan Officer. 



When they do so, all related Notes from the agent or loan officer will be shared with the Buyer and Co-Buyer. Please keep in mind that all parties can view all such Notes. We recommend Notes be limited to discussion about specific properties and not personal financial or loan-related information. Those conversations are best offline to keep them confidential.



How do I add any home to Robin®?



Enter the street address of a home you want to favorite, or if you found it online, paste the home’s link so we can pull the address for you. We aggregate data from multiple sources. However, as we continue to evolve our coverage, some listings may not surface. This is particularly true for data in a) smaller geographies; b) markets with unique or changing definitions of active inventory; c) markets with limited or partial listings; and d) coverage markets with limited or partial sales coverage.



How are the estimated home values calculated?



Our source for the home value estimates is a leading AVM (automatic valuation model) provider that utilizes public market data and its own statistical models to arrive at an estimated home value. The provided estimate is a computer-driven mathematical model based on the available public data, not an appraisal of your home. As with all AVMs, the estimated value should be viewed as indicative only – to better understand all the market intricacies that can determine the actual price a home will sell for, we encourage you to speak with a real estate agent.How do I change my notification preferences?



Robin® users can update their notification preferences at any time by going to their account and selecting Settings. 



What notifications do I receive through Robin®? 



Buyers and co-buyers are notified when:



You receive a Robin® invitationYou’ve successfully sent a co-buyer invitationA co-buyer joins the boardSomeone adds a home from a 3rd party link or manually by addressSomeone creates a new saved searchSomeone archives or updates a saved searchNew listings are added to a saved search Someone adds a comment to a home or likes a commentThere are new agent recommended homes for you to reviewSomeone clicks the Make an Offer button and notifies the agentSomeone pins a photoSomeone requests a private showing or schedules an open house through Robin®A co-buyer is removed or leaves the boardA home card is moved between columns



What if I want to work with a different agent, but I want to continue using my Robin® board? 



At this time, buyers can only use Robin® if they are working with an eligible agent. If you would like to change agents, please reach out to support@listreports.com to talk with a Customer Success representative about your options. 



What if I don’t want to work with my paired agent’s designated loan officer? 



Buyers are under no obligation to work with the loan officer paired with their agent on the ListReports® platform. The loan officer featured in the Mortgage Center and on each home detail card is simply a suggested option for buyers looking to finance their home. 



Who is ListReports®?



ListReports® is the company behind Robin®! Robin® is the first consumer product that ListReports® has released in their quest to make buying and selling a home a truly delightful experience.
